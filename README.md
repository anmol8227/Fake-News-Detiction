# Fake-News-Detiction
# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning & NLP

This project aims to identify **fake news vs real news** using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
The model uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and multiple ML algorithms to classify news articles accurately.
